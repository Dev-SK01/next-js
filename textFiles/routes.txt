---------------------------- ROUTING ---------------

1. next is based on routing , it uses app or page routing  , 

2. in app/page.tsx is the index for the next js app

3. while creating the router we need to use the same url name for the dir-name in next-js

4. Each router should contain page.tsx or jsx file

5. next-js routing is based on  the directory , route name and the directory name should be same

6. each app router page.jsx is index file

--------------------- Routing Segments ------------

1. Routing Segments emad nested routes /r1/r2 like that...

2. we need to create a nested folder structure for the path ./r1/r2/page.tsx

--------------------- Dynamic Routing --------

1. if the route url is changing we use dynamic routing.

2. creat folder in the base url in sub folder use [url-variable].

3. create page.tsx and create component. next give us params object when we creat folder like this.

4. in this params object we can acess the url value params.url-variable.


---------------- Dynamic Multiple Segments ---------

1. for that we use [...url-var] --> it mentions all the folders are dynamic route.

2. here we can acess the value by the index , it an array of  values
